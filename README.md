# SafeP4R compiler

This repository contains:

  * In `safeP4R/`: The code for the SafeP4R API and type generator, as well as examples that use the API.
  * In `vm/`: A virtual machine that sets up a simulation network using mininet, which can be used to test the API.

## Prerequisites

__This project requires:__

  * [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) (for building the project)
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (for running the examples)
  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (for running the examples)

## Quick test run

  1. Navigate to the `vm/` directory.
  2. Run `vagrant up` to build and run the VM. Building the VM for the first time will take 10-15 minutes.
  3. When the VM has started:
     3.1. Log in to __safeP4R__ user using the password `safeP4R`.
     3.2. Open a terminal in the VM, navigate to `/home/safeP4R` and run `make test`.
          This will start the mininet network with four hosts and four switches (see the `topology.json` file for the layout).
          It also applies `config1` to `s1` and `s2`, and `config2` to `s3` and `s4`.
  5. Now, navigate to the `safeP4R/` directory on the host machine.
  6. Run `sbt "runMain safeP4Rtest"`. This will run the program in `src/main/scala/examples/safeP4Rtest.scala`,
     which connects to the mininet network in the VM and sends some test queries to the `s1` switch.
     If everything goes well, it will print `Test successful!`.

## Further detail

### Project layout

The source code directory `safeP4R/src/main/scala/` contains several different subfolders:

  * `protobuf/`: The "untyped" P4Runtime API code, generated by [ScalaPB](https://scalapb.github.io/docs/installation)
    from the protobuf specification (which itself is found in `safeP4R/src/protobuf/`).
  * `typegen/`: The type generator, which parses a given P4info file and outputs "equivalent" Scala 3 types.
  * `api/`: The type-parametric SafeP4R API used for making P4Runtime queries.
  * `examples/`: Examples that use the SafeP4R API with generated types. Requires the VM to be running.

### Type generation

To compile a P4info file into a Scala 3 package, use

    sbt "runMain parseP4info <p4info-file> <package-name>"

where `<p4info-file>` is the path of the P4info file to be compiled, and
`<package-name>` is the name of the package to be generated.
The generated types are written to stdout.

## Reproducing examples

All of the examples can be run by using

    sbt "runMain <main-function>"

where `<main-function>` is the `@main` function to be run
(usually named the same as the example file itself).

All existing examples require the VM to be running. Each example has precondition
that the network switches have no table entries; for this reason, in the VM,
close the mininet network (ctrl+d), run `make clean`, and then run `make network` in between each example run.

### Simple IPv4 table update

TODO

### Multi-switch update

TODO

## Creating a new scenario

1. take a working example from above
2. slightly change the P4 program (e.g. rename a table, or an action, or the tweak action params)
3. redeploy the updated P4 program
4. use the updated P4Info file to regenerate the SafeP4R types
5. show that the example at point 1 does not compile anymore --- and it is good, because the example is now buggy
6. show how to fix the program so it type-checks wrt. the updated P4Info
